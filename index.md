## Reference page
This small site is where I store quick reference information. 

It's not designed to be pretty, or fully featured, or complete, or evern correct -- rather it's a quick and dirty place for me to put links, information, etc. that I'd like to refer to later.

Basically, content that's not worth putting on a more fully features CMS.
