This is my quick reference site. It's designed for me to quickly be able to put up
small bits of documentation, reminders to myself, quick snippets for cutting and
pasting, and so on. Basically, for anything where it doesn't seem like it is
worth adding it to a more fully featured CMS.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the modified [Cayman-Blog](https://github.com/lorepirri/cayman-blog)
theme.
